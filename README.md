# Firebase Data Type Mismatch Error

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when working with Firebase Firestore: data type mismatches. This error arises when your code expects a certain data type from Firestore, but the actual data type stored in the document differs. This can result in unexpected behavior or runtime errors.

## Problem

When reading data from Firestore using the Firebase SDK, it's crucial to ensure that the expected data type matches the actual data type of the field. Failure to do so will cause the Firebase SDK to throw an error, potentially leading to application crashes or unexpected behavior.

## Solution

The solution involves implementing robust error handling and type checking within your application.  Prior to accessing a field's value, verify its type using appropriate methods provided by the Firebase SDK.  This includes explicit type checking using `typeof` or similar operators. Additionally, it's always beneficial to handle potential errors gracefully using `catch` blocks.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository
2. Install the required dependencies using `npm install`
3. Run the `bug.js` script (This will cause an error)
4. Run the `bugSolution.js` script (This demonstrates a solution)
