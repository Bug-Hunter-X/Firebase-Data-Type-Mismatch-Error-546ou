The Firebase SDK might throw an error if the data type of a field in your Firestore document doesn't match the type you're trying to read it as. For example, if you expect an integer but the field contains a string, you'll encounter an error.  This can be subtle and difficult to debug if you're not carefully checking data types during development and testing.  Here's an example of how that might look in code:

```javascript
db.collection('myCollection').doc('myDoc').get().then((doc) => {
  const myNumber = doc.data().myField; // Error if myField is a string
  console.log(myNumber); // this line might not execute
});
```
